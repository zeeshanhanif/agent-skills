# Execution Guide (the task loop)

Mechanics for Phase 3 — one task at a time, in tasks.md order, each executed
the same way. The loop's invariant: **after every task, the repo is in a
state a fresh session can pick up cold** — checkboxes current, work
committed, nothing important only in memory.

## Per-task cycle

1. **Read the task**: its done-when, the design sections it points at
   (technical-design §N / ui-design section), and the FR/UC it serves. If the
   task references a design section that doesn't answer what implementation
   needs, that's a divergence (see failure-and-escalation.md), not a license
   to invent.
2. **Survey the touchpoint**: the files this task changes, the conventions in
   force there (technical-design §2 recorded them; the code confirms them),
   the stubs to replace (skeleton stubs carry comments naming their
   replacing feature).
3. **Implement** the smallest change that satisfies the design. Follow the
   established envelope/error/naming conventions exactly — a second
   convention is a defect even if internally clean.
4. **Satisfy the done-when in its stated kind.** tasks.md writes each
   done-when as the right kind for the task's nature; execute the
   classification, don't improvise it:
   - **Behavioral tasks** (logic, decisions, transformations, contract
     semantics, validation) — the done-when names test artifacts: author them
     with the task, in the inherited frameworks (from the harness — never
     introduce a different runner), tracing to the acceptance criteria (name
     the AC/FR in the test description where natural). They are the done-when
     made runnable and rerunnable.
   - **Structural/realization tasks** (schema objects, wiring, realizing a
     screen spec, config) — the done-when is a demonstration: it applied
     cleanly, it builds, it renders and conforms. Zero new test files is
     legitimate here; the behavior gets covered by the tasks that build logic
     on the structure. Never manufacture ceremony tests — and never skip the
     demonstration either. Verification is universal; test artifacts are not.
5. **Run the done-when** — actually run it: the test command from
   scaffold-notes/agent-instructions, the migration against the local store,
   the rendered screen against its spec. **Start from a known state**: don't
   trust something already listening on the expected port — a leftover
   process from an earlier session serves *old code*, and a test that passes
   against it is a false green on work this run never did. Verify the running
   process is this run's, or restart it (bring the local stack up per
   scaffold-notes' commands). Green → proceed; red → the fix-loop.
   **Verification timing is three-tier**: a task's own done-when is all that
   runs per task (task-scoped, fast — never the E2E suite, which mid-feature
   has no complete path to traverse); the feature's E2E extension runs at its
   own pre-minted task, ordered after wiring/UI so the path it tests exists;
   the **full suites** — whole-repo tests, complete E2E including prior
   features' flows — run once, at the final verification task's gate.
6. **Task hygiene, then commit**: boundary/lint rules pass; no debug
   leftovers; tasks.md box checked; commit
   `FEAT-NNN T<k>: <imperative summary>`. One task, one commit — don't batch.

## Tasks that introduce a configuration variable

A task needing a new environment variable (a service URL, a key, a tunable)
handles it **in the same task**, three steps:

1. **Add it to the owning unit's config template** — name plus placeholder,
   never a working value; mark it under the secrets grouping if disclosure
   would cause harm, and note its scope if it isn't universal (`# prod only`).
   The templates are the project's variable inventory; an unrecorded variable
   effectively doesn't exist.
2. **Set it in the local config** so the task's own done-when can actually
   run — real local value, gitignored file, never the template.
3. **Flag it in the delivery summary as a deployment-affecting change** —
   "FEAT-007 adds `REDIS_URL`; deployed environments need it before the next
   deploy." A variable not captured at birth becomes a service that dies on
   boot after a perfectly green pipeline.

## UI tasks specifically

- Screens come from the manifest entry: **registered/generated** → realize
  from the source locator, conformance rules still binding (the tool design
  is the layout authority; the design system is the values authority);
  **code-native** → build from the spec section, then the **screenshot loop**:
  render, screenshot, compare against the spec and design.md, fix, re-render —
  bounded by the same attempt rule as everything else.
- **Tokens, never raw values.** design.md's Do/Don'ts are binding. A needed
  value with no token is a design-system gap → escalation path, not a
  hard-coded hex.
- State supplements in the manifest (empty/loading/error specs) are part of
  the screen — not optional polish.

## The E2E task (when pre-minted)

tasks.md carries it only when the feature touches an architecture-named
critical flow. Extend the existing suite in the E2E workspace — same
framework, same conventions as the skeleton seed — to cover the path this
feature completes. It runs against the real local stack; a red E2E is a real
integration failure (diagnose which side), never a reason to loosen the spec.

## The final verification task

Always last, always present — and **it executes under the same per-task
cycle and bounded fix-loop as every other task**: a failing criterion or a
red suite here triggers diagnose → fix → re-run, up to the attempt bound
(each fix committed against the responsible earlier work), and exhaustion
stops the feature short of developer-done with the honest blocked state.
Before spending attempts, classify the red: code wrong → fix it (the normal
case); the acceptance test misencodes a criterion → fix the test *toward the
design* (legitimate, doesn't burn the budget the same way — record it in the
commit); the criterion itself unsatisfiable as designed → **divergence, stop
immediately and escalate** — no attempts are owed to a broken design.

Author the acceptance-level tests here if the
per-task tests don't already cover every criterion in technical-design §6 —
each criterion demonstrably checked, cited by AC/FR ID. Then the full gate:
feature suite green, whole-repo suite green (this feature broke nothing),
boundaries clean, E2E (when owed) green, **the coverage gate green where the
project enforces one**, no WIP markers in tasks.md or code. **The
anti-fake-green rule extends to coverage**: the threshold, its scope, and
its exclusion/ignore lists are configuration this skill never edits to get
green. A red coverage gate has the same two honest paths as a red test:
write the missing tests (the normal case — coverage red means behavior went
unasserted), or, if the threshold itself is genuinely wrong for this
codebase, that's a configuration divergence → escalate toward the
architecture's coverage stance, never quietly lower the number. Only then is
the feature developer-done.

## Session discipline

- **One task per iteration** is the unit of progress; a session may run many
  iterations, but each completes (or cleanly blocks) its task before the next
  begins. Never two tasks half-done.
- **Resume protocol**: on entry, the first unchecked box is the position; if
  it carries a WIP note, that note is the starting context — verify the
  described state against the actual code (the note may predate a human's
  intervention), then continue inside the remaining attempt budget.
- **Process hygiene — stop what this run started.** Anything started to
  demonstrate a done-when (dev servers, workers, the local stack) is stopped
  when that demonstration completes, tracked by the handle it was started
  with. At session end — **including a blocked stop, where it matters most** —
  nothing this run started is still running. Something deliberately left up
  (a dev server shared across several tasks in one session) is named in the
  delivery summary with the command to stop it. **Never kill by port scan or
  name pattern**: that port may belong to the user's editor, another project,
  or a database they run natively — this skill stops only what it owns, and
  handles a stale foreign process by starting clean (above), never by killing
  it.
- tasks.md is updated **in place, boxes only** — never restructured. A task
  that proves wrong-sized or wrongly ordered means the design changed:
  escalate, don't edit the program mid-run.
